# Password Manager üîíüóùÔ∏è*Ô∏è‚É£

This is a simple password manager application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and JSON file format to store the data.

## Features

- **Add Passwords**: Easily add passwords for various websites along with your email/username.
- **Search Passwords**: Search for passwords stored in the database by entering the website name.
- **Generate Passwords**: Generate strong, random passwords with just a click of a button.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The application is written in Python programming language. üêç
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. üñ•Ô∏è
- **JSON**: JSON file format is utilized to store the password data in a structured manner. üìã

## Usage

3. **Generate Passwords**:
   - Click on the "Generate Password" button to generate a strong, random password.
   - The generated password will be automatically copied to your clipboard for easy use.

## How it Works

- When you add a password, the application stores the data in a JSON file named `data.json`.
- When you search for a password, the application retrieves the data from the JSON file and displays the corresponding password.
- The application also provides functionality to generate random passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.


## Future Enhancements

- Implement encryption to secure the password data.
- Add an option to edit or delete passwords from the database.
- Improve the password generation algorithm for more complex passwords.
